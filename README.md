An alternative software distribution for the TTGO smartwatch based on ESP32 from LilyGo. Currently under active development (check back often for new functionality) 

Forked from the excellent software by sharandac https://github.com/sharandac/My-TTGO-Watch with some small fixes and different apps. 

* Changed main font (e.g for the timeface) to FreeMono (TODO: Fix naming. Still appears as 'ubuntu')
* Removed crypto ticker
* Removed weather app
* Removed FTP server (TODO: will try to add SSH server for SCP) 
* Removed osmand mapping app
* Removed some of the haptic motor stuff
* Removed update feature for now (TODO: probably to update over SSH) 
* Fixed a sound issue with wav/mp3 playback

# Install

Clone this repository and open it with platformIO. Build and upload. On a terminal in vscode you can do it with

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

or simple press "build and upload" in platformIO.

The first time you may wish to add bluebox mp3 files with:

```    
pio run -t uploadfs     
```    

# known issues

* the battery indicator is not accurate, rather a problem with the power management unit ( axp202 )
~* SSH client sometimes (after a while) produces false 'connection error' and watch needs to be rebooted to restore app to working~ (hopefully resolved)          
* from time to time the esp32 crashes accidentally
* and some other small things

# Improving battery life / stability

* I have found it best for battery and stability to use just the wifi and keep the bluetooth disabled for now     
* I set a plain black background via the settings which seems to make the screenshot process more stable (still some reboots)    
* Seems best to disable webserver when not in use    

# Apps    

## New:-    
*Bluebox*     - bluebox for the phreaks (add the included mp3 files to SPIFFS using `pio run -t uploadfs` the first time)     
*Netscan*     - Simple connect() based port scanner (slow with unreachable/blocked hosts - is there a better way working for ESP32?)    
*Subnet*      - Simple subnet calculator to see how many hosts / valid hosts    
*Ping*        - Ping some IP address     
*IP Lookup*   - Lookup who owns an IP via the ip-info API    
*SSH client*  - Password only for now (no keys - TODO) / (known hosts handling via SPIFFS - TODO)      

## Existing:-
*IR Remote*   - IR remote     
*Stopwatch*   - Stopwatch     
*Alarm*       - Alarm clock     

# Call for ideas    

If you have something you would like to see built for the watch (especially network/security tools) then please let me know using github issues. I will also make a tutorial about how to program your own apps shortly.     
 
# For the programmers

Internal RAM is very limited, use PSRAM as much as possible. When you work with ArduinoJson, include this

```#include "hardware/json_psram_allocator.h"```

and create your json with

```SpiRamJsonDocument doc( 1000 );```

to move your json into PSRAM, here is enough RAM for all the crazy stuff you will do. And use

```ps_malloc(), ps_calloc() and ps_realloc()```

as often as possible.
And one very important thing: Do not talk directly to the hardware!

## Sound
To play sounds from the inbuild speakers use `hardware/sound.h`:

```
#include "hardware/sound.h"
[...]
// MP3 from SPIFFS:
// void sound_play_spiffs_mp3( const char *filename );
// example:
sound_play_spiffs_mp3( "/sound.mp3" )

// or WAV from PROGMEM via
//void sound_play_progmem_wav( const void *data, uint32_t len );

```

There is a configuration tile to enable/disable all sound output and set the global volume.

# how to make a screenshot
The firmware has an integrated webserver. Over this a screenshot can be triggered. The image has the format RGB565 and can be read with gimp. From bash it looks like this
```
wget x.x.x.x/shot && wget x.x.x.x/screen.data
```
I use the following import settings for GIMP:   
* rgb565
* offset 1
* width 240
* height 240
